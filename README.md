# Bamazon
Amazon-like storefront application built with the MySQL & Node.js

I created an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL and Node.js. 
The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. 
The app will track product sales across the store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.

## Getting Started


After you initialize npm with `npm init`, you will need to install `npm install mysql inquirer terminal-table`  
You will also need to replace __port__, __user__ & __password__ in both _bamazonCustomer.js_ and _bamazonManager.js_:
